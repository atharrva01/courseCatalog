## 🧠 Overview

The Course Catalog project is a blockchain-based registry that allows users to store, view, and organize educational course data on a decentralized network. This smart contract demonstrates a simple yet useful implementation of persistent on-chain data storage using Solidity and is designed to be beginner-friendly for Web3 learners.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

This application enables users to:

- Add new courses to the blockchain with a title, instructor name, and price.
- Retrieve details of any course by its ID.
- Track the total number of courses stored in the system.

---

## ✨ Features

- Fully on-chain catalog storage  
- Public and permissionless course creation  
- Indexed course retrieval  
- Minimal ABI for easy integration  
- Supports frontend interaction using wagmi + viem

---

## 🧩 Problem It Solves

Traditional course platforms store educational metadata in centralized databases, limiting transparency, verification, and ownership. This project solves that by decentralizing course metadata storage, ensuring:

- **Transparency**: Anyone can verify course existence on-chain  
- **Permanence**: Data cannot be altered or deleted by a central authority  
- **Open Access**: Any Web3 user can read or add course data  

### Example Use Cases

| Use Case | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Certification marketplaces | Public record of course metadata |
| Web3 LMS platforms | On-chain verified learning path |
| NFT credential issuance | Attach NFTs to immutable course data |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Solidity
- Flare Coston2 Testnet
- wagmi + viem
- Next.js + React

---

### Status: **Live & Testable**

Anyone with a wallet connected to the Coston2 testnet can interact with this contract and add or fetch courses.
